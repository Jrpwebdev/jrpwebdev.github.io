As a passionate and self-taught 3D artist, I've been on an exciting journey of creating and selling 3D game models. I've had the privilege of working with individual commissioners and collaborating with marketplaces to deliver high-quality assets that enhance the gaming experience.

My journey as a 3D artist has been driven by a deep love for the craft and a dedication to continuous learning. Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by pursuing courses at CGMA, further honing my expertise in the field.

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and projects that allow me to push the boundaries of 3D artistry and contribute to the dynamic world of gaming. Let's connect and explore how we can work together to bring creative visions to life.
